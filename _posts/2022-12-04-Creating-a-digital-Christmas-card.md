Hi all,
it's Christmas season! :christmas_tree::santa: Time for visiting Christmas markets, drinking mulled wine, and getting cozy at home. I love festivities and like to use the festivities to link up with my arts & crafts projects. I especially enjoy creating greeting cards with water colour. Anything handcrafted, I am so into it! It makes me feel in a flow state, focused and relaxed, and I am so proud of having something created by myself with my hands. It surely boosts self-confidence and is really great for mental health. I can only recommend it to you!

Today, I want to show you how you can create a digital Christmas greeting card. Yep, and you don't even have to code since there's a lot of OpenSource code out there which you can just clone to your GitHub repository and modify to your wishes. 
It's a great way to send seasonal greetings to your family & friends, colleagues and clients.

Moreover, it's a great way to get into coding and experiment with the creation of these cards! 

Here are the steps I took to create the Christmas card:
1. Export the the files of a template you like and save it to your local folder. I love the template of Łukasz Niedźwiecki on codepen.io: <https://codepen.io/lukasz-niedzwiecki/pen/ZBNmpy>
2. Modify the files as you wish. I just replaced the HTML file for the text on the inside of the card.
3. Upload the files on a new GitHub Repository and publish the page to see the card.

In the end, my card looks like this: <https://jackieqv.github.io/animated-christmas-card/>

Wishing you a happy holiday season ahead! :sparkler:

Lovely greetings,
Janine
