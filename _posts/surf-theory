I recently went to a surfcamp which was one of the most amazing things I've ever done. I love surfing...although I am utterly miserable at it :joy:. We learned quite some theory that I wanted to recap before I forget everything until next summer. What I found most astonishing is how you much you emerge & synch with the nature. You learn to read the waves, wind, you study your surrounding for your safety. Your daily rhythm adjusts to the tides. I mean which sport makes you connect in such a deep level with the nature? It's also a cathartic experience because in the ocean you just concentrate on getting the next wave and forget about everything else in your life. 

So let's go:

The three key factors for surfing are:
- Timing:
- Speed:
- Right angle:


How waves are created:
Waves are a medium, a transporter of energy, and are created and influenced by the interplay of wind, tides and ground properties.

- Wind: Waves are created somewhere in the open ocean by very strong wind that causes the water surface to become agitated. So when the wind blows over the water, the friction creates waves - the wind gives its energy to the water.
- Tides: The gravitational pull of the sun and moon on the earth causes waves (tides). During low tides, the waves are breaking significantly further out than at high tide. At high tide, the water level is much higher, which allows the waves to run longer. 
- Ground properties: Sandbanks and other underground causes waves to break because
