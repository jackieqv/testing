I can't believe this is happening. My blog is live now!
This blog is about everything I am interested in. No limits but always content that fosters knowledge. My interests are in topics such as learning&development, tech economy, tech tricks and computer skills, health & well-being, crafting projects, cooking recipes, Chinese culture and more. I like to see this blog as a medium to document the things I've learned and share this knowledge with the world. This blog is already a project itself because I dived into coding to build this site and it is a continuous project for improving my skills in this area. Also read about my journey of how I set up this blog in one of my first blog posts!
