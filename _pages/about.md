First of all, thank you so much for reading my blog! I am really excited to have built this blog as a platform to share my projects and interests with the world out there. I am inspired by so many things and hope to inspire others here too. This blog is already a project itself because I dived into coding to build this site and learned so much. You can read about my journey of how I set up this blog in one of my blog posts! I like to think of this blog as a learning tool which motivates me to dive deeper into certain topics and share my knowledge with you. These are topics about learning&development, tech trends and economy, health & well-being, crafting projects, cooking recipes, Chinese culture, etc..

Last, but not least, I want to give a huge thanks to my husband Sven who inspires me daily and who sparked my interest for coding.
